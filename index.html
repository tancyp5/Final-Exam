<p> First, you ultimately have to decided what PHP app you want to use. For building websites, I would prefer WordPress over Joomla for a couple reasons, but extra research would be needed to make that decision for yourself.

<p> Once you've made your preference, it's time to install. For this example, I'll use WordPress. WordPress is a massive website. You will need to go and download all of its functionalities on its website. When on the website, there should be a button for you to click that allows you to download everything you need to get started. You'll be given a zip file, you'll then have to expand the zip file to be able to look through everything. The next step you'll have to go through is setting up your Amazon Web Service account to host your WordPress site.
</p>

<p>Depending on how long you plan on using this, you might have to pay for it. But, basically you have to utilize AWS in order for these types of apps to work. After that is set up, you have to set up the confiuration file to make sure everything in your file is compatible with the functions of WordPress. Once the configuration file is tinkered with, you will need to upload all of your files to your instance on AWS. After this step, whatever changes, edits or updates you make will be updated through the server. 

  <p>Many different themes and plug-ins are available for you to choose from as well. They are super easy to browse and select. You can download themes and plug-ins straight from the WP website. Again, some are free, but if you like a certain one, you might have to pay for it. You can also add administrators and other important people to your site so they can also have control over it. You can assign people to only be editors, so they can update the site and add posts, but not change anyting technically. WordPress gives you tons of options to play around with and try to help you perfect your site. 
</p>
<p> You will have a strange URL when you initially create your site. There are domain names for sale for you to purchase and make it your own. However, some domain names can be very expensive. So again, it all comes down to your preference and how much money you're willing to put into it.

<p> *Important note: your link is live once eveything is conencted through AWS, so don't share your account information with anyone and watch what type of content you upload because whoever stumbles upon the link will be able to see what you've done.*
